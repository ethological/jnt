thank you all for what you did and how much you helped, it was a wonderful time working with allof you

a lot of people either labeled it a good obfuscator or the best.

this was released due to [3000IQPlay](https://github.com/3000IQPlay) being very not nice and nuking the jnt discord server.
..and then trying to sell the source code.

further more he censored ritchy (the original leaker who had leaked jnt in the past) for posting the link lol because he wanted to sell the source code and profit for himself.

[3000IQPlay](https://github.com/3000IQPlay) could not accept the rules established by the product, e.g. he was disallowed to obfuscate radium by himself
because **it's the rules**, if he does it wrong not knowing the product properly (which he doesn't) i will be blamed for it, not him, secondly he was **only**
licensed to obfuscate krypton, if everyone went around obfuscating each other's commercial products then i would be flat broke.

for the other stuff he said i dont really plan to defend it as half of what he said is either taken out of context garbage
or stuff he just doesn't agree with and refuses to give detail on what actually happened.

# "Selling jnt behind everyone's back!!!!!!"

no. i am selling jnt2 behind quote on quote everyone's back, i made it, i wrote it, you had absolutely no contribution to it therefore you are not entitled to any money gained from it,
apparently selling behind everyone's back means in an open ticket on the discord server which they can all see and chat in.

i do not excuse the richy leak, it was a mistake on my part and well my consequence was my product being leaked to the public.

# "Voil source leak blackmail"

it isn't really blackmail when voil's owner threatens to crack echo (protected by jnt) and ventura (protected by jnt),
lwes (voil owner) was warned many times that he cannot just attack other customers because he feels like it, i told him he can do it if he is willing to accept a source leak.

lwes has done a lot of **questionable** things in the past too but, i wont dig them up to satisfy the cravings of this community and continue to fuel the drama.

# "Almost leaking voil!!!!!!!!!!"

nobody leaked voil, some people told us they might be using jnt's source code to write their obfuscator, which is obviously very wrong to do, so we admittedly with a temper, went to ask lvstrng and lwes about what they were doing.
they denied this, we asked them to show source code (not leak it just structure) or they get banned and voil gets leaked, so they showed a screenshot of the project's structure and then we pissed off knowing our source code wasn't used to write another commercial product.

# "JNT JAR CONTROL!!!! SCARYYY!!!!"

kid. we do not have a client, we cannot do obfuscation in any other way without leaking jnt's jar (which already happened due to how bad the situation got with money, later it was fixed up but a few jnt jars were sent out to customers just to keep their products afloat), it was never about no jar control and [3000IQPlay](https://github.com/3000IQPlay) knew that because he was quite literally part of our team, we did not have a client which i pestered the dev to write and well it was faceless but i wont really get into what happened and why he wont or whatever, i dont plan to bring drama to faceless because eventhough we currently are not doing too well with eachother he is still my friend, a friend who isnt how [3000IQPlay](https://github.com/3000IQPlay) is, eventhough me and faceless' friendship is significantly shorter than the history me and [3000IQPlay](https://github.com/3000IQPlay) have.

# "KRYPTON SCAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

boy you fired me from it before i could push my changes which i still have btw, and called it scamming?
i had already done work for krypton, i wrote stuff which i cant really discuss about what exactly i wrote since well that could expose krypton's security practices but long story short i had already committed to krypton a few times before i was fired,
i had also warned gacha (krypton's main developer or whatever he is) that i will not have internet in my dorm room... which he completely ignored and did not reply to me, after that one lovely evening i was met with a text saying i was fired.... sooooooooo?

# summary

so basically, this was a load of sh*t that i woke up to in the morning, people spammed me multiple times saying what was happening though i was asleep, **keep your eyes peeled, this repo might be updated 👀**
